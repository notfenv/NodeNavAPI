# Hi.
This is the official documentation for my <b>NodeNavigator</b> class that is used as an alternative to Roblox's pathfinding.

# All .luau code here only serves as documentation code, and will not work in an actual game. Contact [@notawildfox](https://www.roblox.com/users/124963457/profile) if you wish to gain access to both the NodeNavigator script, as well as the nodegraph plugin.
